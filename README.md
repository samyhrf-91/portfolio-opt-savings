This project is about the optimisation of a portolio, in a context of pension savings.
This code is organised in sections to make it easy to get started.

Firstly, we assume that the log-returns are normally distributed. We then go through the project from assignement a) to assignement d)

In a second time, we import market data of the risky asset in order to compute realistic log-return values (assignement e). The market data can be found in the csv file Indexdata.csv . 
We check that the log returns are normally distributed thanks to a QQ-plot. Once it's done, we again go through the project from assignement b) to d).

We conclude this project by comparing results between the simulated log-returns and market data log-returns.
